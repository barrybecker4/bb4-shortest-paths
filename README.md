# bb4-shortest-paths

Some shortest path algorithm implementations and visualizations.
 - Dijkstra's algorithm - single-source shortest paths 
 - ModifiedDijkstra's - shortest path between two nodes
 - Yen's algorithm - finds the K shortest paths between two nodes

A GraphViewerApp is also provided. It allows you to view the graph test cases.

## How to use it

Run ./gradlew to build and run the tests.

The default application is the GraphViewerApp. It allows you to view the graph tests cases and their results.
For example, here is a shortest path result
