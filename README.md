# bb4-shortest-paths

Some shortest path algorithm implementations
 - Dijkstra's algorithm - single source shortest paths
 - ModifiedDijkstras - finds shortest path between two nodes
 - Yen's algorithm - finds K shortest paths between two nodes

A GraphViewerApp is also provided. It allows you to view the graph test cases.

## How to use it

In bb4-shortest-paths, the scala solution is in
`com/barrybecker4/shortestpaths/<project>App.class`

Run `./build.sh` to create the executable

In another shell, go to `bb4-shortest-paths/<project>` and run it. </br>
